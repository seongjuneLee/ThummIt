If you purchase products or services or sign up for a subscription, then we may also ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in content you post, publish, submit, upload, transmit, or otherwise make available on the Service, such as profile pictures or information, photos, images, music, videos, information, comments, questions, messages, works of authorship and other content or information, as well as associated metadata (“User Content”). If you sign up for our email mailing list, we will collect your name and e-mail address. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.\nInformation we may receive from third parties — We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the ThummIt application, linking your account to the Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to ThummIt. This information could include, but is not limited to, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. We may use this information to find your contacts on the Service, to let you know what your contacts are doing on the Service, and to let your contacts know what you are doing on the Service. We may also use it to suggest additional users or friends you may want to follow or connect with. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to ThummIt’s websites or Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service.\nInviting a third party to use our Service — You have the option to sync your contacts list on your mobile device with the Service so that you can invite your contacts to join the Service via email or text message. You choose which contacts to invite, and you send the invitations from your own email or text messaging app. We do not share your contact list with third party marketers or send messages to your contacts directly unless and until they register for the Service. Your invitees may contact us at any time to request that we remove his or her information from our database using this form.\nMetadata — We may collect metadata associated with User Content. Metadata typically consists of how, when, where and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content has been formatted. Users can add or may have added metadata added to their User Content including keywords posted with a photo or video, including names, geographical or location information, comments or other data. This makes your data more searchable and more interactive. However, the metadata may be accessible to others if you share the User Content with others or on third party social media sites.\n\nWe use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. We may also use this information to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences.

A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.\nLocation data — When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device.

Although we do not sell your information to these companies for money, our use of these services may constitute a “sale” of Personal Information from which you have the right to opt-out for purposes of the CCPA.

If you purchase products or services or sign up for a subscription, then we may also ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in content you post, publish, submit, upload, transmit, or otherwise make available on the Service, such as profile pictures or information, photos, images, music, videos, information, comments, questions, messages, works of authorship and other content or information, as well as associated metadata (“User Content”). If you sign up for our email mailing list, we will collect your name and e-mail address. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.\nInformation we may receive from third parties — We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the ThummIt application, linking your account to the Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to ThummIt. This information could include, but is not limited to, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. We may use this information to find your contacts on the Service, to let you know what your contacts are doing on the Service, and to let your contacts know what you are doing on the Service. We may also use it to suggest additional users or friends you may want to follow or connect with. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to ThummIt’s websites or Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service.\nInviting a third party to use our Service — You have the option to sync your contacts list on your mobile device with the Service so that you can invite your contacts to join the Service via email or text message. You choose which contacts to invite, and you send the invitations from your own email or text messaging app. We do not share your contact list with third party marketers or send messages to your contacts directly unless and until they register for the Service. Your invitees may contact us at any time to request that we remove his or her information from our database using this form.\nMetadata — We may collect metadata associated with User Content. Metadata typically consists of how, when, where and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content has been formatted. Users can add or may have added metadata added to their User Content including keywords posted with a photo or video, including names, geographical or location information, comments or other data. This makes your data more searchable and more interactive. However, the metadata may be accessible to others if you share the User Content with others or on third party social media sites.\n\nWe use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. We may also use this information to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences. We may also use your information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices).

We may collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.\nCookies information — When you visit the Service, we and our third party partners may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets ThummIt help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site.

A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by ThummIt. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.\nLocation data — When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device.

This is called interest-based advertising. See the section of our Privacy Policy entitled Use of Cookies and Other Technology to Collect Information for details. Although we do not sell your information to these companies for money, our use of these services may constitute a “sale” of Personal Information from which you have the right to opt-out for purposes of the CCPA. You can opt-out of the use of your information for interest-based advertising by:\n* Browser settings. Blocking third party cookies in your web browser settings.\n* Privacy browsers/plug-ins. Using privacy browsers or ad-blocking browser plug-ins that let you block advertising trackers.\n* Ad industry tools. Opting-out of interest-based ads from companies participating in the following industry opt-out programs:\n    * Network Advertising Initiative: https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.aspx\n    * Digital Advertising Alliance:\n        * Opt-out (optout.aboutads.info), which will allow you to opt-out of interest based ads served by on websites by participating members.\n        * AppChoices mobile app (available at https://www.youradchoices.com/appchoices), which will allow you to opt-out of interest-based ads in mobile apps served by participating members.\n* Mobile settings. Using your mobile device settings to limit use of the advertising ID associated with your mobile device for interest-based advertising purposes.\nWe recommend that you take all of these steps if you want to prevent collection of your information for interest-based ads. You will need to apply these opt-out settings on each device from which you wish to opt-out.

If you opt-out, you will still see advertisements online but they may be less relevant to you.\nYour right to information, access and deletion. You have the following rights under the CCPA:\n* Information. You can request the following information about how we have collected and used your Personal Information during the past 12 months:\n    * The categories of Personal Information that we have collected.\n    * The categories of sources from which we collected the Personal Information.\n    * The categories of third parties with whom we share the Personal Information.\n    * The categories of Personal Information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose.\n    * The categories of third parties to whom the Personal Information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose.\n    * The business or commercial purpose for collecting and/or selling Personal Information.\n* Access. You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you during the past 12 months.\n* Deletion. You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.\n* Nondiscrimination. You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discriminatory treatment prohibited by the CCPA.\nYou may submit a request to exercise your right to information, access or deletion by contacting us at account tap.
